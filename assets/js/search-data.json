            "content": "Momentarily seeing the writing on the wall . I want to leave the country…just spent a long time writing on the UMD iSchool Parents Slack space about it, following after this conversation about RBG dying | Sigfried Gold Sep 18th at 8:32 PM I’m sorry to bring up politics again, but this has been feeling like the most comforting social space I have access to right now. Have you heard about RBG yet? My wife’s been crying. I’m just stunned and feeling freaked out, not sure whether to be looking at plane tickets to somewhere, put the house on the market — maybe go door to door and ask the neighbors if they know of any liberal Takoma Park militias I can join. I spent a few minutes on twitter and that just made everything worse. Sorry again….I’ll just scroll up and down this page and take deep breaths while looking at cute pictures of all our kids. | . | 2 12 replies | Susannah Paletz  2 months ago I’m attending a remote/Zoom Rosh Hashanah service and at the beginning someone mentioned it in chat. I’m just gutted.  Hard to focus on the service. | . | Renee F Hill  1 month ago Hi all. Sorry to jump in so late; I don’t tend to check emails during the weekend. Siggie, please don’t apologize.I can’t type the message I sent to a friend when I first heard the news about RBG. It’s completely unprofessional and I want y’all to still think I’m respectable.I’ll just go with “gutted” as the perfect word that others have shared. | . | 3 | Sigfried Gold  1 month ago Hey @Renee F Hill. Thanks for saying I don’t need to apologize. It’s nice to know that I can express myself freely …. at least if I stay this side of whatever you said to your friend.  Part of my apology was about not knowing the etiquette around expressing political sentiments; but it was also partly to signal that I hope I’m not causing discomfort for anyone whose politics might be very different from mine. | . | Renee F Hill  1 month ago Absolutely understood your intent. I don’t think your expressing grief about RBG’S passing and the fate of our nation is political. I think it’s human. And IF it’s somehow considered to be “politically offensive”, I’d like to believe that this is also a safe space for someone to respectfully inquire about why you feel the way you do. | . | mhinckle  1 month ago I like the idea of a space where our differences are okay too, political or not. RGB’s passing is world tilting. It is one more thing adding to my feeling of this while time being surreal. | . | Sigfried Gold  5:14am I don’t want to live in the world’s most destructive, spiteful, delusional shithole country anymore. (Sorry to use trmp’s racist term, but I’m too upset not to reflect back its contemptuous, dehumanizing belittlement back on the people who endorse it.) In case anyone thinks I’m the first here to report on some horrible news like with RGB above, last I checked, most of the swing states are leaning red, but that was expected and it will take days or months to count up all the votes (or, just as likely as this point, not). But even if Biden somehow comes out of this winning the electoral vote, either tr%#@mp will win in the courts, or his supporters will believe the election was stolen from them and will seriously start pushing for civil war. | The public support for Black Lives Matter makes the situation here different from germany in the mid-30s. But tr@#$mp’s recertified popularity does point to an acceleration of the centuries-long genocide of Black people. Anti-semitism (which I mention because I’m not Black but am Jewish) is not that great a concern yet since tr@#$@#$mp is allied with racist zionism. And I bring up mid-30s germany because the smart people got out, the brave people (of which I am not one) stayed and fought, and everyone else was either complicit or slaughtered. | My academic work feels like it doesn’t make sense in this country anymore. If I worked on clearly political, social-justice-oriented issues, I could at least see myself fighting the good fight in dark times. But my intellectual work is technical, and intentionally non-partisan, which made sense in a country where the easing of partisan, ideological tensions was still possible. But if Anthony Fauci is about to be fired, how can I possibly pretend that my technically and philosophically abstruse projects have any place in this country? With the NIH, FDA, AHRQ, (CDC once upon a time), CMS, and most of the top medical research centers , we have the greatest healthcare minds and resources in the world here — which have been made ineffectual for years by insane market and political forces. But now… | Anyway, all that it to say, I sat down 45 minutes ago to start my morning’s work on my dissertation proposal, and all I can think about is: New Zealand? Toronto? Montreal? The UK (surprisingly good medical informatics there), or the Netherlands (not the best informatics systems, but great research)? Secession? A New Anti-Racist Mayflower to … ? … Mars? Newfoundland? Some Third-World country that might welcome refugee intellectuals and technologists? | Anyone want to come? | . | Sigfried Gold  01:58pm Ok, Biden’s ahead. Maybe sanity will prevail and the supreme court won’t turn it over to tr@#$mp, but, assuming the gop keeps the senate, the supreme court is still stacked against justice, we get four more years of paralyzed government. But maybe Fauci gets his job back after sitting tr#$%ck fires him just for fun. So, I guess I can continue working on my PhD in fair-to-middling conscience. | . | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
